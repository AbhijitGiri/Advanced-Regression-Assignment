## <ins>General Information</ins>


In this assignment we will be using Regression modelling approach in order to derive a model which predict the factors influencing the cost of the house. The dataset being used is of a Company known as Surprise Housing which is an US based
housing company. The provided dataset consists details of houses and their important features which are sold in Australia.<br>
The main business problem is to explain the business which all factors predominate in predicting the prices of the house and how it influences the prices of the house. With the obtained analysis and conclusion the Business can optimize and manipulate its strategy to focus on houses yeielding high returns.<br>
The project will help to use and understand Regression modelling using Regularisation on a real world Business Problem.<br> 
The dataset and the associated data dictioanry is fetched from the link provided by Upgrad in the corresponding assignment section.<br>

## <ins>Conclusions</ins>
1. The overall area of the house in square feet impacts the prices of the house extent to great extent. The area includes Ground floor area, basement area, second floor area, basement area.<br>
2. The overall condition and quality of the house also impact the prices. If both the qulaity and condition is excellent the house price will be more compared to a property whose qulaity and condition is average.<br>
3. House having a pool will have higher price than house having no pool. Also the higher the quality and area of the pool, higher will be the final price of the house.<br>
4. More the number of full bathrooms, more will be price of the house.<br>
5. More the number of available fireplaces more will be the price of the house.<br>
6. The number of cars which can be parked in the garage also impacts the price. Greater is this number greater will be the housing prices.<br>
7. Neighbourhood of the house also place a important factor in determining the house prices. Houses in areas such as Stone Brook,Northridge,Somerset generally have higher prices than houses located in neihbourhood such as Oldtown,Mitchell ,Edwards.<br>
8. Houses with roof made up on wooden shingles have higher prices than houses having composite shingle.<br>
9. Houses located in Hillside,level type of surface have higher prices than ones located on banked and depressed surface.<br>
